## Elemental Impurities Data (ICH Q3D)

Dear Sir / Madam,
BASF is pleased to provide the attached elemental impurity information including data on three individual, commercial production batches in analogy to the ICH Q3D approach. In order to fulfill your need for excellence in customer support, BASF has chosen to invest significant resources into screening and validating of analytical methods for all ICH Q3D elements in class 1, 2A, and 3. Any class 2B elements which are intentionally added in BASF's manufacturing process are tested as well. All data were obtained via a validated ICP-MS method.

The attached analytical report is intended to support your risk assessment and control strategy for the concerned finished drug product. In certain cases, this data could enable the use of a component approach to testing, although ICH Q3D places the responsibility of obtaining elemental impurity data on finished product manufactures - not API or excipient suppliers.

We are convinced that our elemental impurity information provides a significant added-value and again demonstrates BASF's commitment to being a leading supplier to the pharma industry.
We sincerely appreciate your business and look forward to continuing to service your needs in the future.
